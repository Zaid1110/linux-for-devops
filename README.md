# Linux for DevOps — Hands-On Practice by Zaid Aftab

This repository documents my complete Linux learning path for DevOps and Cloud Engineering.  
It contains daily hands-on tasks, scripts, troubleshooting practice, and real-world scenarios used by DevOps engineers in actual companies.

The goal of this repo is to publicly showcase my progress, build a strong foundation, and demonstrate real, practical skills through organized daily work.

## 📌 What's Inside

### **day1/**
My first set of Linux practicals. Covers navigation, user management, permissions, logs, networking basics, and my first automation script (`system_health.sh`).

### **day2/**
Will include file permissions, process management, package management, and service troubleshooting.

### **day3/**
Will include networking tools (nslookup, dig, curl, traceroute), SSH key management, and log analysis.

### **scripts/**
A dedicated folder for standalone automation scripts I build during learning:
- `disk_monitor.sh`  
- `user_audit.sh`  
More scripts will be added as I progress.
