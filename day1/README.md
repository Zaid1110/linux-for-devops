# Day 1 — Linux Fundamentals for DevOps

This folder contains all the work I completed on Day 1 of my Linux training.  
The goal for today was to build a strong foundation in essential commands, navigation, permissions, logs, and basic automation.

Everything here represents real tasks DevOps engineers perform on production servers.
